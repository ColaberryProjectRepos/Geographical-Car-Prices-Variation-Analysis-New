that geographic location can influence car prices by up to 15%. This project
explores the intricate relationship between geography and pricing by employing
advanced geospatial analysis and RidgeCV regression model. Through this
approach, we identified key factors driving regional price variations. The
insights gained provide valuable data to car dealerships and pricing
strategists, enabling them to refine their pricing strategies in line with
regional market trends.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
